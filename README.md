ℹ️ Created in 2022 by [Pierre Raybaut](https://github.com/PierreRaybaut), developed and maintained by the [PyPlanning](https://github.com/Codra-Ingenierie-Informatique/PyPlanning) project team with the support of [Codra](https://codra.net/).

PyPlanning is a small planning tool initially developed for internal use at [Codra](https://codra.net/). The main goal of this project is to provide a simple and easy-to-use planning tool for small teams or small projects, i.e. in cases where using a full-featured project management software is overkill.
