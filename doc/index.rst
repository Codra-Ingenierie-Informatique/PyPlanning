PyPlanning is a library for managing team schedules and quickly creating simple
project plannings.

PyPlanning was initially developed for internal use at `Codra`_.
The main goal of this project is to provide a simple and easy-to-use planning tool
for small teams or small projects, i.e. in cases where using a full-featured project
management software is overkill.
